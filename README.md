<h2>Ideas for Data Science Project</h2>
1. Drinking and Driving:
    * We would figure out the most popular alcohol to drive on
    * How many people die compared to sober drivers
    * How many kids die in drunk driving related accidents
    * Other fun statistics

2. Surfing:
    * What board do high performance surfers 
    * What is the ideal wave type
    * Cross reference this with a weather dataset and find the ideal conditions for those qualities

3. Best Places to Bartend:
    * Where do people order the most diverse drinks
    * Where do people prefer spirits to other types of alcohol
    * cross reference this with average pay and work hours from a different dataset
